## General
* What is binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Binary Tree Structure
### Root
The node not having any parent.

### Node
Contains data and link to another node. Elements of a tree are called nodes.

### Parent node
A node with at least one child and at most two children (that's why it is called Binary Tree).

### Leaf node
A node without child/children. It is also called an external node.

### Path
Sequence of consecutive edges from source node to destination node.

### Ancestor
Any predecessor node on the path from root node to that nod### Descendant

### Descendant
Any successor node on the path from root node to leaf node.

### Degree of a node
Number of connections it has to other nodes.

### Depth of a node
The length of the path from root to that node.

### Height of a node 
The number of edges in the longest path from that node to a leaf node.

### Level of node
The number of edges from root to the given node.
