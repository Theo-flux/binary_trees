## General
* What is binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Binary Tree Structure
1. <h3>Root</h3> The node not having any parent.

2. <h3>Node</h3> Contains data and link to another node. Elements of a tree are called nodes.

3. <h3>Parent node</h3> A node with at least one child and at most two children (that's why it is called Binary Tree).

4. <h3>Leaf node</h3> A node without child/children. It is also called an external node.

5. <h3>Path</h3> Sequence of consecutive edges from source node to destination node.

6. <h3>Ancestor</h3> Any predecessor node on the path from root node to that nod### Descendant

7. <h3>Descendant</h3> Any successor node on the path from root node to leaf node.

8. <h3>Degree of a node</h3> Number of connections it has to other nodes.

9. <h3>Depth of a node</h3> The length of the path from root to that node.

10. <h3>Height of a node</h3> The number of edges in the longest path from that node to a leaf node.

11. <h3>Level of node</h3> The number of edges from root to the given node.
